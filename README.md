# Kidney_stone_detection

Kidney stones are the common complaint worldwide, causing many people to admit to emergency rooms with severe pain. Various imaging techniques are used for the diagnosis of kidney stone disease. Specialists are needed for the interpretation and full diagnosis of these images. Computer-aided diagnosis systems are the practical approaches that can be used as auxiliary tools to assist the clinicians in their diagnosis. In this study, an automated detection of kidney stones using coronal computed tomography (CT) images was proposed with deep learning (DL) technique which has made significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. A total of 1,799 images were used by taking different cross-sectional CT images for each person. Our developed automated model showed an accuracy of 96.82% using CT images in detecting the kidney stones. We have observed that our model is able to detect accurately the kidney stones of even millimeter size. Our developed DL model yielded superior results with larger dataset of 500 subjects and is ready for clinical application. This study shows that recently popular DL methods can be employed to address other challenging problems in urology.
